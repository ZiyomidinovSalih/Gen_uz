# Overview

This project is an Enhanced Telegram Task Management Bot built in Python. Its main purpose is to facilitate comprehensive task assignment and tracking between administrators and employees. Key capabilities include creating tasks, assigning them, tracking completion status with media, and generating detailed reports. The bot supports advanced features like location sharing, real-time employee tracking, Excel-based reporting, debt management (including a "Boshqalar" category), handling various media files (photos, videos, voice), direct employee management, comprehensive data management, and multi-step task completion workflows. The system is designed for small to medium-sized teams needing sophisticated work assignment management through Telegram with professional reporting capabilities.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Task completion flow: Employees should return to main menu (employee panel) after completing tasks, not task list.
